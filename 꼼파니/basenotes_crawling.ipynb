      "Review : Okay Tom Ford, I see you over there with the 50 pages worth of listed notes, but what is actually in Tom Ford Costa Azzurra (2021)? For starters, this is a retooling of the Private Blend iteration of Tom Ford Costa Azzura (2014) and re-release into the Signature Line in the same manner that Tom Ford has done with several other Private Blend releases, but sees a bit more noticeable of a shift in tone than the previous transfers to the Signature Line. The original Costa Azzura was an aquatic and this new version is not, so right away there's that to get past. Secondly, with the birth of this new Signature Line entry comes the death of so many other Signature Line fragrances loved by the online fragrance community, including Tom Ford Noir (2012) and Tom Ford Noir Anthracite (2017), meaning Costa Azzurra feels something like a signifier of a more-commercial direction change for the house (also read \"the death of the brand\"). I'm not so sure how accurate this is considering stuff in darling genres to the fragrance community like Ombré Leather (2018) and Beau de Jour (2020) got put into the Signature Line too, so let's just say that Tom Ford maybe just decided to switch out one retro vibe for another, with this newest Signature Line adoption feeling like the first thing he's put out in that line which targets a distinct early 90's aesthetic. Costa Azzurra is marketed unisex, but one sniff will communicate 90's \"men's cologne\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's get out of the way the fact that there is no discernable oud in this scent, despite whatever the Baskin Robbins 31 flavors note pyramid tells you. I get a very similar golden fruity sort of ozonic feel which reminds me very much of vintage Tommy by Tommy Hilfiger (1994), which considering that brand is also governed by Estée Lauder like Tom Ford, makes this linkage a very real possibility. Once the heart heats up, things change in tone to become more resinous yet still slickly modern like a better take on Acqua di Colonia Assoluta (2003), with standout ozonic citrus and fruit notes of the top being mulled with cardamom, benzoin, juniper, herbs, and patchouli. The base is richer still, offering a golden almost Chanel No. 5 (1921) type glow minus any animalic facets with a synthetic oakmoss chypre riff blended into olibanum and mastic with bit of vanilla. Gone are the aquatic top notes from this version, with the only thing really linking it to the old Costa Azzurra being the fruitiness and floral parts of the scent. The base is the biggest difference here, and the decision to go more with citrus than remain aquatic is the deciding factor over whether or not you'll like this version. Wear time is a long noticeable 10 hours and this feels best as a casual spring through fall scent but is warm enough for year-round use in climate-controlled evironments with brief jaunts between car/bus/taxi and wherever you're headed when outside on a cold day. I think a woman could pull this off if they were fans of that golden fruity ozonic period and wore stuff like Creed Millésime Impérial (1995) at that time, and you could almost say this is Ford's answer to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom Ford Costa Azzurra does fill a sort of niche lacking in the Signature Line up until this point, and that was for a fresh dumb-reach kind of scent that didn't feel like a throwaway aquatic a la many Nautica releases, but also wasn't the stiff traditional masculinity of something like Grey Vetiver (2009). We may never see a fully abstract post-aquatic \"blue\" fragrance like Bleu de Chanel (2010) or Dior Sauvage (2015) enter the range to fill this need, and that's a good thing. I don't believe the usual Tom Ford customer is looking to smell like they're keeping up with The Joneses, but also doesn't want to scour eBay for overpriced surviving examples of truly vintage fragrances, so they buy into the slightly less-overpriced \"repackaged timelessness\" that is essentially Tom Ford perfumes. Costa Azzurra is the first time TF masculines have targeted a 90's style, as past entries have floated between the powdery animalic glory days of Guerlain in the 20's to the very hairy-chested Burt Reynolds vibe of the 70's and 80's, most of which represents stuff sadly culled from the TF line-up. While aforementioned options still exist if you wanna get your prestige postmodernism groove on, it is nice to see TF do something that isn't an ambery or smoky baroque period piece but still clearly inspired by things we don't see much of anymore. I mean, who wears Tommy anymore (besides me)? However you slice it, Costa Azzurra is potentially divisive, but a needed drop of sunshine on an otherwise overly serious (and overly expensive) line. Thumbs up.\n",

      "Review : H24 is light and slightly green with musky florals. It also has a metallic, skin sweat scent in the late drydown that gives me a Dior Sauvage vibe (not even close to a clone, just a slight similarity in that one aspect). Not a wow-factor scent but it is pretty unique. \n",
      "\n",
      "For me, its more enjoyable on skin than on clothes or tester strips. \n",
      "\n",
      "Projection is light from start to finish but it does have decent longevity. I can still smell a light scent over 10 hours on skin. \n",
      "------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Review : Somehow I feel compelled to like Hermès H24 (2021) right away, but like most things that greet me with an overtly friendly smile, I force myself to remain aloof just for a bit and to wait for how their true personality unfolds after they get more comfortable. Indeed, H24 presents itself as a \"high-tech fougère consisting of three vegetal elements\" and then name-drops sage, narcissus, and rosewood as it's only notes, so I am made wary despite my usual openness to futuristic synthetic abstraction a la Calvin Klein. Early testers also claim this smells like something straight out of the 90's, but as someone with a fair amount of 90's fragrances in my collection, I'd have to disagree with that assessment. Christine Nagel has indeed made a high-tech scent here, as most of my review going forward has me breaking down aromachemicals rather than traditional notes, making this write-up feel especially rote, but bear with me. Perhaps the most interesting thing about H24 is how it takes current trends towards sweet-ish ambroxan-powered \"blue\" masculines and turns them on their head, doubling down on the classic green masculine themes that made Terre d'Hermès (2006) so standout in an ocean of aquatics during its own launch 15 years prior. Hermès like Chanel still marches to the beat of its own drum, and that can only be a good thing to me. Will this succeed the oft-copied Terre d'Hermès as the mainstay of the Hermès masculine lineup? Probably not, as H24 reads as the Creed Viking (2017) to Terre d'Hermès' Creed Aventus (2010), if we're making analogies.\n",
      "\n",
      "The opening of H24 has something a bit fruity and sharply aldehydic, which is perhaps where the 90's comparisons come from. Limonenes, citral, citronellol, and farnesol are basically responsible for a brief fruity lemon verbena feel alongside some trace naturals to support it, while saliclyclates, galbanum, vetiveryl acetate, and alpha-isomethyl ionone are here to bring the green grassy floral aspects of the narcissus note, while sage is represented dryly by sclarene, with the same metallic mineralic note found in Terre d'Hermès making a return. Geraniol and eugenol are listed in the ingredients, so a bit of that metallic feel comes from the former, while the eugenol is likely for a clove-like effect that joins the trace amounts of oakmoss and linalool to represent the rosewood, and what feels like a sliver of modern woody-amber aromachem. Which aromachem this is I can't say because the doseage is so low (which is what's proper for materials like this), but that slight scratchy warmth is there nonetheless. On the whole this smells nice, green, and transparent as if Nagel is still channeling Jean-Claude Ellena, but I like it enough to want a bottle. Wear time will take you through a work day at 10 hours but projection is about medium since this is so sharp and ethereal overall. You'll catch pangs of the metallic elements all day. No patchouli means H24 will definitely feel safer for the office than Terre d'Hermès ever could, and H24 is punchy enough to survive the cold but fresh enough for heat, making it a good choice in all situations except romantic ones where a sweeter or spicier scent would work better.\n",
      "\n",
      "The lack of lavender for me stretches the definition of fougère here in the same way Creed Green Irish Tweed (1985) also does by calling itself one despite not including it, although that is a nitpick on my part. I like H24 but I admit my initial excitement based on the hyperbolic reactions of others (those damned YouTube shills haha) was brought down a few pegs once the dry down hit, and not because it's a bad dry down, but just because it's the \"business as usual\" dry down you expect from the generally-transparent Hermès house style, which has really ceased to be about leather like the old days and become more about chasing Jean-Claude Ellena's mojo like Austin Powers escaped from his cryogenic pod again. I mean fine, if Nagel wants to intermittently live in the shadow of a previous house perfumer, at least she does it well and doesn't pull a Sammy Hagar by trying to re-invent the entire vibe of the outfit when she filled vacant shoes, opting graciously for maintaining consistency instead. I think people who miss Creed Vetiver Geranium (2014) are probably the best candidates to adopt H24 as a replacement or adjunct to it. As for where this leaves hardcore Hermès fans, I don't know, as most of them clocked out after Terre d'Hermès released and some are even still stuck on Bel Ami (1986), never making it past rejecting Rocabar (1998) as the then-new Hermès male direction. My suggestion is keep an open mind when sampling H24, and if the cyberpunk fougère theme in the drab metal-shouldered bottle fits your vibe, then pull the trigger on one. Thumbs up. \n",
      "------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Review : TLDR: Rating: Good (3.8/5). Mild up-thumb.\n",
      "\n",
      "After 2 partial day wearings from a full bottle, I am cautiously optimistic about H24: this line will probably eventually give rise to a very special fragrance.  But this first H24 release is not a special scent.  \n",
      "\n",
      "This scent is a minimalistic green aromatic with citrus and metallic notes.  It bucks current designer trends and seems an almost perfectly calculated office scent.  (If we ever get back to a society where offices are again a thing, this fragrance might become popular with folks who are tired of the blue/aquatic inoffensive blandness of the pre-pandemic blockbuster workplace scents.)  \n",
      "\n",
      "This product is the embodiment of tasteful restraint.  There is nothing here to dislike, although the \"frag bros\" will fault H24 for lack of \"beastliness\".  Those of us who will celebrate the bros' frustrations will mostly like it, but will not find anything compelling enough in this scent to move us to love.\n",
      "\n",
      "I cannot join the voices I've heard who celebrate H24 for being challenging because it is not.  Rather,it is bland and inoffensive in a different way than most bland and inoffensive scents. The publicized metallic note is mildly interesting and works well with the grapefruit opening which it follows in the scent's progression.  The light floral note is not as successfully integrated into the composition.\n",
      "\n",
      "The base here is a pleasant enough melange of woods made just a little bit atypical by the metal of the Sclarene.  I think the metallic notes push this one into the more masculine side of the ever-blurring gender divide, but it is nearly unisex and I am sure there will be women who choose to wear and enjoy H24.\n",
      "\n",
      "Siliage is minimal and longevity is just under 8 hours on my skin, the last 2.5 hours of which are essentially as a skin scent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps in the summer, the season for which I think this fragrance is best suited, additional nuances will emerge from this juice, but as I wear this version of H24, I cynically believe the more intense formulation(s) is (are) already awaiting release as the weather gets cooler in the northern latitudes.  The flankers almost suggest themselves: \"Intense Metal\", \"Eau Tres Fraiche\" or \"H24 Cologne\", anyone?  I suppose that original formulations designed to support flankers is the landscape on which the entire designer industry now walks, for better or worse.  But after 15 years, perhaps we were entitled to expect a bit more confidence and daring from a house that last gave us the celebrated Terre.\n",
      "\n",
      "In any event, this one is nice enough for what it is and gets a mild thumbs up from me particularly because this scent is atypical enough to be of at least some interest for many fans of designer fragrances.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Presentation is fine, but not special.  The bottles are not distinctive, but they are well executed and tastefully restrained--just like everything about H24.  Ultimately, Hermes played it safe here, which is a shame because a bit more confident risk taking in the direction they have moved with H24 could have given us all something great.\n",
      "\n",
      "------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Review : Hermès call this a high-tech fougère, and with a radiant burst of pear and stewed apple, lemon-lime, aromatics and powderiness, its clearly a fougère - at least from the start. \n",
      "But when you add some major synthetics, H24 seems less traditional. Along with a tangy green citrus, theres nutty-spikiness and a thick sweetness, which are familiar from Citron Noir.\n",
      "What is new, however, is a note of aluminium. It takes the spiky woods and, smoothing them out a bit, gives them a high tech metallic feel. H24 portrays vibrant masculinity, slightly more chic and upmarket than the spiky woods, and, although it doesnt feel especially young compared to them, its younger than the vintage Hermès masculine. Its aimed at the Sauvage crowd, who, having aged a few years, are ready to move on to something a bit more aspirational. \n",
      "On the other hand, there has been speculation this may be the follow up to Terre dHermès, and with a woody core between the tangy citrus and the steroidal base there seems to be some mileage in that. But if that were the case, with its aluminium accent this would be Métal dHermès.\n",
      "H24 is a modern green fougère that unveils a welcome new take on the spiky woods. Its clever and well made, and it gives a nod to its stablemate, so why not a full endorsement? Because the aromachems are still too manic for my taste.\n",

      "Review : Paco Rabanne Invictus Victory (2021) is a loaded gun pointed at your self-respect, but I'll get to that in a minute. I used to think that ever since designers realized there's more profit in pushing perfume as the bottom line over ready-to-wear apparel, that putting out one shamelessly commercial focus-group made fragrance to fund every half dozen or so more creative things (usually taking the form of flankers to the main less-interesting pillar) was okay, because business is business. You look at Chanel for a good example of this practice being maintained, with a Bleu de Chanel (2010) or Chance Eau de Toilette (2002) powering a dozen or more Les Exclusifs and flankers, but it seem some designer brands like Paco Rabanne have increasingly gotten greedy and decide to live in the moment rather than maintain any long-term respect with buyers. No better case for this has there been than the exploitation of their biggest successes on the men's side of the perfume counter, with inane flanker after inane flanker of Paco Rabanne 1 Million (2008), or Paco Rabanne Invictus (2013). completely ignoring the legacy of their classics like Paco Rabanne pour Homme (1973) or dumping b-sides to these same garbage flankers as flankers of \"lesser\" lines instead, a la Paco Rabanne Pure XS (2017). Here with Paco Rabanne Invictus Victory, we see another stab at the DNA of 1 Million, but cross-pollinated with \"Invictus DNA\" and given a bit of what made Versace Eros (2013) so special. I guess this is marginally better than the insulting Invictus Onyx (2020), which was just the OG in a limited edition bottle with a single note tweak.\n",

      "I guess I can see a bit of why Paco Rabanne would want to copy Eros, since it is the biggest competitor to 1 Million in the club circuit where these fragrances do battle while their wearers dance and try to \"scoop up chicks\", but like when Coca-Cola launched New Coke to be more like Pepsi, Paco Rabanne is basically throwing the fight by doing the same thing with Invictus Victory. The opening here is familiar territory to all Invictus fans, and probably the best part, with that telltale grapefruit and mandarin showergel ethyl maltol and calone blast mixed down with less ozonic or aquatic properties this time around because we're not going for \"fresh\" in quite the same fashion. This fruity sweetness is instead shored up with thickening pink pepper that bridges to what feels like an entirely different scent upon the initial dry down. A really synthetic lavandin note similar to what is in Calvin Klein cK One Shock for Him (2011) comes into play, but it isn't joined by lovely cocoa or tobacco notes like in the Calvin Klein, but is instead made scratchy with the usual woody amber nonsense you find in designers going for \"incense\" in fragrances made for cost. Luckily, this doesn't turn into sandpaper because a very sweet vanilla tonka note joins that lavender to make something very similar in tone to Eros minus the mint, with the \"Invictus DNA\" replacing the apple. Wear time is about 8 hours but projection is shockingly poor, which further detracts from value. Best use if you were to use this at all (woe be to you) is probably just at home, since you're the only one who is going to smell it, and barely that after an hour.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a would-be clubber, this sucks. Adding insult to injury is the fact that Invictus Victory is marketed as \"Eau de Parfum Extreme\", like it's supposed to be some thermonuclear warhead filled with ultimate swag that makes everyone in the club uncomfortably aroused and scared simultaneously. When you think that Paco Rabanne already has a half dozen fragrances that could serve in this purpose including many 1 Million flankers such as 1 Million Privé (2015), you start to wonder if this exists with a purpose in mind, or just a shameless \"in the now\" cash-grab for all the knuckle-draggers out there who live and die by having \"the latest and greatest\". You know who I mean, the kind of guy that sells off a fragrance when his favorite spin-clapping YouTuber tells him it's played out, whether he still likes it or not, or the kind of guy that makes it a point to tell me they wear a Detroit T-shirt and leather jacket with the fragrance in rebuttal of me disliking it, as if somehow completing a \"look\" with the fragrance makes it objectively smell better. If you are a fan of these thick and sweet tonka bomb clubbers (and I indeed like the aforementioned genre-defining entries in this style myself), you can do far better than Invictus Victory. Paco Rabanne themselves could have done better than this, simply by not doing it at all. We honestly have enough \"Invictus DNA\" fragrance be they flankers or competitors, so rather than shoving it into a competitor's formula and calling it done, Paco Rabanne should really be thinking: \"Where do we go from here?\" Thumbs down\n",

      "Review : Matangi opens with a very brief blast of relatively sharp orange blossom with an underlying soapy ylang-ylang before quickly transitioning to its heart.  As the composition enters its early heart a green tinged jasmine emerges and takes the fore, supported by the now more prominent neroli spiked soapy ylang-ylang and a rose-like geranium, with slightly creamy orris adding additional support. During the late dry-down the composition morphs into a smooth vanilla driven perfume with mild supporting relatively dry amber through the finish.  Projection is good and longevity is excellent at over 12 hours on skin.\n",
      "\n",
      "On paper Matangi hits all the right buttons for this writer's perfume preferences...  Jasmine, vetiver, and ylang-ylang are all favorites.  Of course, a published note list doesn't mean that much, it is what the wearer actually sniffs, and when analyzed from that angle, the composition is a bit of a mixed bag.  The jasmine is the real focus of the perfume through its heart phase.  Unfortunately the jasmine featured is more of a green tinged, slightly sharp version quite unlike the indolic heady jasmine grandiflorum this writer prefers.  The ylang-ylang is more successful, but it couples with the geranium to yield a bit of a dough-like soapy floral accord that smells good but not great, while undermining the jasmine to some degree in the process.  The vanilla led late dry-down is surprisingly pleasant, with the supporting dry amber never calling attention to itself, instead providing just the right amount of body to the vanilla, enhancing the overall effect.  The bottom line is the $90 per 50ml bottle extrait strength Matangi may be a bit of a mixed bag, but the \"good\" to \"very good\" 3 to 3.5 stars out of 5 rated perfume's whole is better than the sum of its parts, earning it a recommendation to floral indie perfume lovers.  \n",
